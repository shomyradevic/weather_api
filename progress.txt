792680 - Belgrade, rs ID
- There are several Belgrades around the world. There cannot be two or more files with same name. Filenames are
    identical as city name. Next Belgrade will always override the Belgrade before that. That is not acceptable.    
- old json_files =  161,810 files
- new json_files = 168,647 files -> It works!!! Belgrade, RS/BE/US exists!
- Code classificates cities in city.json without errors.
- search/ path is engineered well. Ajax and NoAjax requests are regulated.
- timezone problem:
    sunset and sunrise are exposed locally, from my local datetime. It means that, currently in LA, 
    sunrise is at about 15:31:00 and sunset at about 21:48:00, which is not correct. 'timezone' key in API
    response can be positive or negative (It's a offset in seconds). We can use it to process our 
    sunrise and sunset data, and then return it to client. https://www.epochconverter.com/timezones
