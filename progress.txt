792680 - Belgrade, rs ID
- There are several Belgrades around the world. There cannot be two or more files with same name. Filenames are
    identical as city name. Next Belgrade will always override the Belgrade before that. That is not acceptable.    
- old json_files =  161,810 files
- new json_files = 168,647 files -> It works!!! Belgrade, RS/BE/US exists!
- Code classificates cities in city.json without errors.
- search/ path is engineered well. Ajax and NoAjax requests are regulated.

<div id="loc">City: {{ location.name }}</div>
